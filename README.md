# Covid-app 2020

Since the virus in question attacks our respiratory system and hinders breathing ability, doctors have concluded that an efficient way to predict the prognosis is to examine the X-ray of patients.

We have employed Deep Learning in our application which uses the VGG16 which is a deep convolutional network for object recognition.

We have used the VGG16 as the base model and on top a custom made model to suit the requirements of the application. 

DATASET USED - [Dataset of Covid patients](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset.git)

Accuracy obtained - 90%

Specificity - 80% i.e. People who dont have covid and are diagnosed as negative

Sensitivity - 100% i.e. People who have covid and are diagnosed as positive **which shows that there is no scope of error in the prognosis**

## Objective

1. Use of deep learning in the app to predict whether the user is prone to coronavirus.
2. Real time location updates of coronavirus infections all around the globe with current news on covid-19 of that location.

## Architecture

The deep learning model uses VGG-16 architecture which is a deep convolutional network for object recognition developed and trained by **Oxford's renowned Visual Geometry Group (VGG)**, which achieved very good performance on the ImageNet dataset.
It is used as a base model while a top model is used to refine the model based on the requirements of this application. The weights used are pre-trained of the imagenet dataset and the architecture of the entire model is shown as below: -

## Application

The application is developed in flutter. It can be run simply by downloading app-release.apk and installing in your mobile phone. It accesses the API(link above) to use the trained model to predict COVID-19. A live tracker is also included in the application to keep track of status of COVID-19 cases around the world.
